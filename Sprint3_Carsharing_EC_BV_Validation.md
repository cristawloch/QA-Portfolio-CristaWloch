## 🚗 Sprint 3 – Carsharing Requirements on Urban Routes App

In Sprint 3, I focused on validating **carsharing functionality** within the Urban Routes application. This included manual test planning for:

- 💳 Card number input validation using EC/BV techniques  
- 📅 Booking logic and time constraints  
- 🚘 Vehicle availability and selection flow

All tests were manually executed in Chrome and documented in Google Sheets with structured formatting for developer readability.

### 🔍 Card Number Field – EC/BV Test Design

I applied **Equivalence Class Partitioning** and **Boundary Value Analysis** to test the card number field:

### 🧭 Carsharing Requirements Coverage

I also validated core carsharing flows within the Urban Routes app:

- ✅ Vehicle selection and availability logic  
- ⏱️ Booking time overlap and duration constraints  
- ⚠️ Error messaging for invalid payment inputs

These tests ensure the system handles real-world usage and edge conditions gracefully, supporting a seamless user experience.
