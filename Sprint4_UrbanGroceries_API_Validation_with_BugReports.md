## 🛒 Sprint 4 – API Testing for Urban Groceries App

In Sprint 4, I focused on backend API validation for the Urban Groceries application. This included:

- 🔄 Endpoint response verification  
- 🧪 EC/BV test design for input parameters  
- 🚫 Negative scenario handling and error messaging  
- 📦 Data integrity checks across cart, checkout, and inventory flows

All tests were manually executed using Postman and documented in Google Sheets with structured formatting.
