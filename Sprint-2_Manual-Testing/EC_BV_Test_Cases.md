## 🧪 Sprint 2 EC & BV Test Case Summary – Urban Routes App

This sprint focused on validating the **Urban Routes Map** feature using **Equivalence Class Partitioning (EC)** and **Boundary Value Analysis (BV)**. We manually tested 10 scenarios (F-1 to F-10), all of which I personally designed as part of the test planning process to align with the feature spec and expected user flows. These cases covered:

- ✅ Valid inputs across all transport modes (walk, bike, drive, transit)  
- ⚠️ Invalid entries like empty fields, special characters, and unsupported modes  
- 🧭 Edge cases such as matching From/To locations and long-distance routes  

Each case was designed to probe input boundaries and ensure accurate travel time calculations.
