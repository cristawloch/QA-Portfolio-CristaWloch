# 🗺️ Sprint 1 Bug Report Summary: Urban Routes Map

As part of Sprint 1, I conducted manual QA testing on the Urban Routes Map feature, identifying key visual and usability issues that could hinder user navigation and clarity. All bugs were documented in Jira with full reproduction steps, environment details, and severity/priority ratings.

## 🧪 QA Approach 
- Focused on visual clarity, user interaction, and accessibility
- Reports include full reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and developer-ready notes

## 🧩 QA Philosophy

Each bug report reflects my commitment to:
- **Clarity**: Making issues easy to understand and reproduce
- **Traceability**: Ensuring developers have all the context they need
- **User Empathy**: Prioritizing real-world usability and intuitive design
